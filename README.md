# RationalKnotFertility
Mathematica code to calculate the fertility of rational knots.

"Rational Knot Resultants.nb" and "Rational Link Resultants.nb" are tabulations of the resultants of all rational knots (1 component links) of 11 or fewer crossings, and all rational links (2 component links) of 10 or fewer crossings. 

To find resultants for any (rational) links you're interested in, use the code in "Rational Link Resultant Finder.nb". 

Since github doesn't play the nicest with Mathematica notebooks, all three files are included in the zip file "RationalLinkFertility.zip".

If you use this code for any official purposes, please cite an upcoming paper, currently submitted to the Journal of Knot Theory and its Ramifications.
